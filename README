/puppet

  Defines two Vagrant boxes, one acting as Puppet master and the other one a Puppet agent to that master
  Useful to test more complex Puppet manifests, check what runs in the master vs. what runs in the agent,...
  Used to test the puppet-maven module amongst other things

/sonar

  Defines a Vagrant box with Sonar installed using the puppet-sonar module
